I looked up in my blog, and there is no record of VAE, ELBO, or flow models. These are the contents I spent quite some time on, but it's right before I started blogging my learnings. So I would review all these contents again. 

and gladly I found this video from WesLab, which gives a great overview of DDPM and DDIM, and make me understand classifier-free guidance for the first time.
